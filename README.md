# generative-3d-models

Geometric primitives and fractal/recursive objects
defined and generated algorithmically for 3d printing
using openscad (https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenSCAD_User_Manual)

* ultrametrics_primitives - various primitives and building blocks
* fractal_growth - recursive fractal growth, IFS-style
* sphere_recurse_shell - (printable) sphere shell recursion
* sphere_recurse - (printable) spheres recursively surrounded by smaller spheres
* cube_complex_recurse - recursive cube constellation
* cube_recurse_3d_2 - (printable) cube recursively surrounded by smaller cubes
* cube_recurse_3d - cube recursively surrounded by smaller cubes (w/ randomness)
* cube_internal_twist - 'infinite' nested 3d cube frames
* cube_internal_twist_2 - thicker frame (nearly printable) 'infinite' frames
* cube_solid_internal_twist - (printable) 'infinite' nested 3d cube frames
* diamond_grid - (printable, barely), nested sparse frames
* brownian_twist - twisted pentagon vase
* twisted_rings - (printable), nested rotated rings
